# Part VII: Build additional experiments to be able to provide an illustration of Shallow and Deep Machine Learning as well as Generative AI on all four Big Clouds. The experiments covered in Parts I-VI above should count towards the complete set of experiments provided as part of your assignment solution for Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Big Clouds.

I am using docker image to dev but encountered several package installation errors. I was not able to proceed further without the packages being installed properly.
```
docker run --rm -it -v .:/home/  --network host  --entrypoint  /bin/bash python:3.6.2
```
